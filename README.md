# BLE Joystick Library Tester for ESP32

# Overview

This project sets up basic BLE functionality in a Heltec Lora Wifi ESP32-S3 device I had lying around. It is primarily intended to
test a separately developed BLE Joystick library for my ESP32. Specifically, a remote device -- aka an Android application -- can enable/disable functions, trigger events, send joystick
events to this embedded device.  Additionally, the remote device -- aka the Android application -- can also receive console messages from this embedded device -- all via Bluetooth Low Energy.

This code is intended to work in conjunction with:
- its Android counterpart
at [https://github.com/efhilton/BluetoothJoystick](https://github.com/efhilton/BluetoothJoystick).
- the BLE Joystick Library itself.
