# BLE Joystick Library

# Overview

This project sets up basic BLE functionality in an ESP32 device.

Specifically, a remote device can enable/disable functions, trigger events, send joystick
events, and receive console messages from this embedded device -- all via Bluetooth Low Energy.

This code is intended to work in conjunction with its Android counterpart that can be found
