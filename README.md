# BLE Joystick Library for ESP32

# Overview

This project sets up basic BLE functionality in an ESP32 device.

Specifically, a remote device -- aka an Android application -- can enable/disable functions, trigger events, send joystick
events to this embedded device.  

Additionally, the remote device -- aka the Android application -- can also receive console messages from this embedded device -- all via Bluetooth Low Energy.

This code is intended to work in conjunction with its Android counterpart that can be found
